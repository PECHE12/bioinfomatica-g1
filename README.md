## 1.10.3 PLANT-POLLINATOR NEWTWORKS
Saavedra and Stouffer (2013) studied several plant pollinator networks. These can be represented as rectangular matrices where the rows are pollinators, the columns plants, a 0 indicates the absence and 1 the presence of an interraction between the plant and the poillantor.

The data of Saavedra and Stouffer (2013) can be found an the directory CSB/unix/data/Saavedra2013.

1. Write a script that takes one of these files and determines the number of rows (pollinators) and columns (plants).
Note that columns are separated by spaces and that there is a space at the end of each line. Your script should return.

$ bash netsize.sh ../data/Saavedra2013/n1.txt Filename: ../data/Saavedra2013/n1.txt Number of rows: 97 Number of columns: 80


2.[Advanced]
Write a script that prints the numbers of rows and columns for each network:

$ bash netsize_all.sh ../data/Saavedra2013/n10.txt 14 20 ../data/Saavedra2013/n11.txt 270 91 ../data/Saavedra2013/n12.txt 7 72 ../data/Saavedra2013/n13.txt 61 17 ...
